          <h1>Outdor Activities (Page 3)</h1>
          <p>Bangladesh is known for a lot of things. Its greenery, the Royal Bengal Tiger, the longest natural beach in the world and oh, its traffic; being the most densely populated country in the world it comes as no surprise. The big cities, especially, are notorious for traffic jams. Lucky for us, there are plenty of ways to get around in Bangladesh apart from private cars and motor bikes. Do keep in mind that some of these transports are exclusive to certain regions of Bangladesh.</p>

              <h2>Old Capital <span id="white">Sonargaon </span></h2>
              <img src="images/sona.jpg" alt="Sonargaon Picture">
              <p>Sonargaon was the old capital of Bengal in the medieval period. It was a mint capital beside Gaur. Although gone is the heritage of the old capital, there still are some interesting things to spend a day in Sonargaon. The main attraction to visit Sonargaon would be the abandoned merchant city, Panam Nagar. Built on the colonial period, this was a city of wealthy Hindu merchants to fled to India during riots after the partition in the subcontinent. They intended to return someday, which never happened. Nowadays, this is a fully abandoned city of 52 houses built on a single street. Other attractions of Sonargaon is the 15th-century Goaldi Mosque and the Folk-arts and Crafts Museum. Sonargaon comes as number thirteen on our list of the best places to visit in Bangladesh.</p>
