          <h1>Mode of Transportations</h1>
          <p>Bangladesh is known for a lot of things. Its greenery, the Royal Bengal Tiger, the longest natural beach in the world and oh, its traffic; being the most densely populated country in the world it comes as no surprise. The big cities, especially, are notorious for traffic jams. Lucky for us, there are plenty of ways to get around in Bangladesh apart from private cars and motor bikes. Do keep in mind that some of these transports are exclusive to certain regions of Bangladesh.</p>

          <h2>Roam around in <span id="white">Rickshaw</span></h2>
          <img src="images/rickshaw.jpg" alt="Rickshaw Picture">
          <p>The number 1 choice here in Bangladesh, the most popular form of transport. Although it was invented in Japan, Bangladesh made it popular. Paris is the city of Light; Dhaka is the city of rickshaws. With approximately 600,000 rickshaws running each day, Dhaka City is known as the Capital of Rickshaws. It is very convenient to travel short distances and even fairly long distances at times. Although one of the major contributors of traffic jam, rickshaws are also responsible for a fair
chunk of employment.</p>

            <h2><a name="targetname1">Public <span id="purple">Bus</span></a></h2>
            <img src="images/bus.jpg" alt="Bus Picture">
            <p>This is the cheapest way to travel within the city and cover long distances.  However, there are several classes. You have the “local” buses which are the cheapest and often feels like travelling in an oven every now and then.  Also, fair warning, it may break your heart when you find out that the term “sitting service” is quite often proven to be a myth.  If you are willing to spend a bit more though, there are services such as Falgun and Anabil which actually live up to expectations. Then there are companies that provide you with buses from brands such as Mercedes and Volvo although they can only be used to travel long distances.</p>

              <img src="images/train.jpg" alt="Train Picture">
              <p>Established during the British period, the railway connects many districts of Bangladesh. It is not only used to travel from one city to another but also within a specific city. Much like buses, there are several classes of trains with local services offering cheaper rates.</p>

                <img src="images/ferry.jpg" alt="Ferry Picture">
                <p>Because of Bangladesh’s numerous water bodies, ferries and launches are useful ways to travel long distances. In rural areas, the use of boats is a very common sight to see. In popular tourist spots such as Cox’s bazaar, Jaflong in Sylhet and even the Sundarbans, boat rides are perceived as a novelty.</p>

                  <img src="images/bdair.jpg" alt="Bangladesh Airlines Picture">
                  <p>Last but not least, we have the various airlines of Bangladesh who offer domestic flights. Certainly not the cheapest mean to travel, not by a long shot, but it is most definitely the quickest.</p>
