          <img src="images/warmu.png" alt="War Museum Picture">
          <p>This museum is a monument to Bangladeshi independence and the war fought with Pakistan for freedom. The exterior is under major renovation and you have to slog through mud to get to it. But by all means get there. There are enough English explanatory boards so that you can truly understand the atrocities. The displays, photos, and videos are harrowing but provide true insight into the Bangladeshi struggles for nationhood.</p>

                  <p>The Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre opened to public on 25 September 2004. It was previously named Bhashani Novo Theatre. It was made autonomous by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre Bill 2010. The space center was commissioned by the Ministry of Science and Communication Technology of the Government of Bangladesh. Sharp, angular architecture contrasts with a central, futuristic dome and well mantained grounds over a wide area. A cavernous feel to the interior which houses a sprinkling of space related posters and exhibits, a virtual show and cafe.</p>
